# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network 
  •	Implemented neural network model presentation in Python to achieve the handwritten digit recognition
  •	Applied feedforward calculations as well as regularized cost function and implemented backpropagation algorithm to fulfill gradient computation
  •	Implemented random initialization and gradient checking to ensure performance
  •	Results of predictions output had an accuracy of 98.02% in training set after regularization
